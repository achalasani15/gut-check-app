# Gut Check 🐶💩

**Gut Check** is a friendly, intelligent health journaling app designed for dogs with sensitive stomachs, GI issues, or food allergies. It helps pet owners log meals, stool events, symptoms, and notes — and over time, surfaces potential food triggers and patterns.

### 🧠 Why It Matters

For many pet owners, understanding what’s upsetting their dog’s stomach is an exhausting and emotional process. Gut Check makes it easier to track, understand, and share insights with your vet — with minimal effort.
